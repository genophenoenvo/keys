# KEYS Summer Internship Project - Working on a machine learning algorithm that could identify trees from aerial data
CyVerse summer internship project

This was a project done over June and July 2020. The goal was to create a machine learning algorithm capable of idnetifying trees from aerial data, such as that from drones. This was done through a combination of the lidR package in R Studio, and the DeepForest package in Python. Here is the lidR code from R studio.
